# Algorithms
This repository contains my implementations of several algorithms and data structures in C++ (credited to others where necessary). It has initially started out as a repository used for an University course, but there are plans to grow it into a repository involving a wide variety of implementations not typically useful for such courses. Will be updated periodically. You are free to use these codes wherever you want without permission. This comes without any warranties though!

# Pull requests
If you spot any errors in the implementation(s), please let me know by submitting a relevant pull request. Furthermore, if you'd like to see a particular data structure or algorithm implemented here, let me know by raising an issue.
